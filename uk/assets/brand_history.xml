	<page>Pingu was born in 1984, the plasticine brainchild of animators Otmar Gutmann and Harald Muecke. Destined for a career on the screen at a young age, Pingu was barely one year old when he made his first appearance in several short episodes. At the time he was not working under his current stage persona and was still answering to the name of Hugo when these episodes were made into a short film.

	<page>Pingu next starred in a pilot movie that was developed in 1986 for Swiss TV and following its success, the show transformed into the television series that we know today. Since then, more than one billion people have seen Pingu on 140 television stations worldwide.

	<page>Today Pingu award winning stop-frame animation is a wonderfully crafted series which involves many talented people: producers, writers, illustrators, animators, directors, photographers, designers. Pingu is unique. Or rather, Pingu is a stand out show. The series is not only very different, but it is quirky, warm and lots of fun.
