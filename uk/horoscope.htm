				<h2>PINGU HOROSCOPES</h2>
<h3>Scorpio</h3>
<p>Secrets, secrets, secrets... There could be a few in the air this month, so make sure you keep them to yourself.<br>For example, I know it would upset my mum to know that I've already found and opened all this year's Christmas presents... so I don't tell her.</p>
			
<h3>Sagittarius</h3>
<p>You crazy Sagittarians, always cracking jokes and breaking the ice. You're the life and soul of the party.<br>...But just remember you can sometimes be tactless too, so take a moment to think before you tell your host their Christmas pudding looks like rabbit droppings.</p>

<h3>Capricorn</h3>
<p>Don't work too hard this month - remember Christmas is nearly here! Believe me... taking a break from typing assignments to check out this website will make you a happier, more festive penguin.</p>

<h3>Aquarius</h3>
<p>You Aquarians should be letting your hair down too. Remember you can be inflexible ... so if you're finding life a strain, take a leaf out of my book and streeeeetch</p>

<h3>Pisces</h3>
<p>I am of course a Pisces. What can I say? We are a fast talking, fun-filled, fish-loving breed. (Modesty is for Virgos...)</p>

<h3>Aries</h3>
<p>It's the season of good will, so make sure you keep that Aries temper in check this month!... I never lose my temper. Never!<br>... What are YOU staring at??!!</p>

<h3>Taurus</h3>
<p>Taureans have a great appetite for life, but don't be greedy this holiday season. Feeling full of festive food can be a drag. I wouldn't know of course. I always know when to stop...<br>Now ... where have all my mince pies gone? And why is my keyboard full of crumbs...?</p>

<h3>Gemini</h3>
<p>Christmas shopping can lead to short tempers in the toy aisles! If things get a bit frosty this month, why not use a double helping of that old Gemini charm to thaw things out? Always works for me! Nug Nug!</p>

<h3>Cancer</h3>
<p>Make sure you resist the temptation to get moody as the nights draw in this month...<br>Be glad you don't live in the Antarctic, where it can be night-time for months on end...</p>

<h3>Leo</h3>
<p>Give free rein to your Leo creativity this months when planning your Christmas party.<br>I always like to warm things up by showing off my baddest breakdancing moves. But only attempt the 'Crouching Krill' if you're as experienced as me...</p>

<h3>Virgo</h3>
<p>Modest old Virgo... always playing down your incredible looks and talent. You know, I'm often mistaken for a Virgo.<br>...But modesty is overrated if you ask fantastic little Piscean me.</p>

<h3>Libra</h3>
<p>Embrace your romantic side this month and plan a heart-warming winter treat for your penguin friend. Be sure it's going to be something they'll like. I'm still not sure that Pingi really enjoyed the seal wrestling championships I took her to last year...</p>
